| RubyGems (the [GitHub org][rubygems-org], not the website) [suffered][draper-security] a [hostile takeover][ellen-takeover] in September 2025.                                                                |
| Ultimately [4 maintainers][simi-removed] were [hard removed][martin-removed] and an reason has been given for only 1 of those, while 2 others resigned in protest.                                            |
| It is a [complicated story][draper-takeover] which is difficult to [parse quickly][draper-lies].                                                                                                              |
| Simply put - there was active policy for adding or removing maintainers/owners of [rubygems][rubygems-maint-policy] and [bundler][bundler-maint-policy], and those [policies were not followed][policy-fail]. |
| I'm adding notes like this to gems because I [don't condone theft][draper-theft] of repositories or gems from their rightful owners.                                                                          |
| If a similar theft happened with my repos/gems, I'd hope some would stand up for me.                                                                                                                          |

## Examples

### Matrix Build

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]
        ruby: ["3.2", "3.3", "3.4"]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: ${{ matrix.ruby }}
          ore-install: true
      - run: bundle exec rake test
```

### Production Gems Only

```yaml
- uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: "3.4"
    ore-install: true
    without-groups: "development,test"
```

### Latest Ruby with Latest RubyGems and Bundler

```yaml
- uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: ruby
    rubygems: latest
    bundler: latest
    ore-install: true
```

### Specific RubyGems Version

```yaml
- uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: "3.4"
    rubygems: "3.5.0"
    ore-install: true
```

### Skip Native Extensions

```yaml
- uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: "3.4"
    ore-install: true
    skip-extensions: true
```

### Custom Working Directory

```yaml
- uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: "3.4"
    ore-install: true
    working-directory: "./my-app"
```

### Specific Tool Versions

```yaml
- uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: "3.4.1"
    rv-version: "0.4.0"
    ore-version: "0.1.0"
    ore-install: true
```

### Custom Retry Configuration

If you experience intermittent failures due to GitHub API rate limiting, you can adjust the number of retry attempts:

```yaml
- uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: "3.4"
    ruby-install-retries: "5"
```

### Building rv or ore from Source

You can build rv or ore from a git branch, tag, or commit SHA instead of using a released version.
This is useful for testing unreleased features or bug fixes. Required toolchains (Rust for rv, Go for ore)
are automatically installed.

```yaml
# Test an ore feature branch
- uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: "3.4"
    ore-install: true
    ore-git-ref: "feat/bundle-gemfile-support"

# Test a pre-release rv tag
- uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: "3.4"
    rv-git-ref: "v0.5.0-beta1"

# Test both from main branches
- uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: "3.4"
    rv-git-ref: "main"
    ore-install: true
    ore-git-ref: "main"
```

> **Note**: Building from source is slower on first run (~3-5 min for rv, ~1-2 min for ore) but cached for subsequent runs.
> Use release versions for production CI workflows.
> See [GIT_REF_FEATURE.md](GIT_REF_FEATURE.md) for comprehensive documentation.

## Migration from setup-ruby

setup-ruby-flash is designed to be a near drop-in replacement for `ruby/setup-ruby` on supported platforms:

```yaml
# Before (setup-ruby)
- uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: "3.4"
    bundler-cache: true
- run: bundle exec rake test

# After (setup-ruby-flash)
- uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: "3.4"
    ore-install: true
- run: bundle exec rake test
```

### With Latest RubyGems and Bundler

```yaml
# Before (setup-ruby)
- uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: ruby
    rubygems: latest
    bundler: latest

# After (setup-ruby-flash)
- uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: ruby
    rubygems: latest
    bundler: latest
```

### Key Differences

| Feature              | setup-ruby       | setup-ruby-flash  |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Ruby Install         | ~5 seconds       | < 2 seconds       |
| Gem Install          | Bundler          | ore (~50% faster) |
| `ruby-version: ruby` | ✅ latest stable | ✅ latest stable  |
| `rubygems: latest`   | ✅               | ✅                |
| `bundler: latest`    | ✅               | ✅                |
| Windows              | ✅               | ❌                |
| Ruby < 3.2           | ✅               | ❌                |
| JRuby                | ✅               | ❌ (planned)      |
| TruffleRuby          | ✅               | ❌ (planned)      |
| Security Audit       | ❌               | ✅ (`ore audit`)  |

## About rv and ore

### rv

[rv][rv] is an extremely fast Ruby version manager written in Rust. It downloads prebuilt Ruby binaries, eliminating the need for compilation. Created by [@indirect](https://github.com/indirect), long-time project lead for Bundler and RubyGems.

[rv]: https://github.com/spinel-coop/rv

### ore

[ore][ore] is a fast gem installer written in Go. It's Bundler-compatible but performs downloads significantly faster using Go's concurrency features. Use `bundle exec` to run gem commands after ore installs your gems. Created by [@seuros](https://github.com/seuros), a long time Rubyist, and prolific [writer](https://www.seuros.com/blog/rubygems-coup-when-parasites-take-the-host/).

[ore]: https://github.com/contriboss/ore-light

### Noncommercial Purposes

You may use the software for any noncommercial purpose.

### Personal Uses

Personal use for research, experiment, and testing for the benefit of public knowledge, personal study, private entertainment, hobby projects, amateur pursuits, or religious observance, without any anticipated commercial application, count as use for noncommercial purposes.

### Noncommercial Organizations

Use by any charitable organization, educational institution, public research organization, public safety or health organization, environmental protection organization, or government institution counts as use for noncommercial purposes, regardless of the source of funding or obligations resulting from the funding.

### Small Business

You may use the software for the benefit of your company if it meets all these criteria:

1.  had fewer than 20 total individuals working as employees and independent contractors at all times during the last tax year

2.  earned less than $1,000,000 total revenue in the last tax year

3.  received less than $1,000,000 total debt, equity, and other investment in the last five tax years, counting investment in predecessor companies that reorganized into, merged with, or spun out your company

All dollar figures are United States dollars as of 2019. Adjust them for inflation according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics' consumer price index for all urban consumers, United States city average, for all items, not seasonally adjusted, with 1982–1984=100 reference base.

### Big Business

You may use the software for the benefit of your company:

1.  for 128 days after your company stops qualifying under [Small Business][small-business]

2.  indefinitely, if the licensor or their legal successor does not offer fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory terms for a commercial license for the software within 32 days of [written request](#how-to-request) and negotiate in good faith to conclude a deal

and [ore][ore] / [Contriboss](https://github.com/contriboss), as this project would not exist without them.

#### How to Request

Request a fair commercial license by sending an email to [peter@9thbit.net](mailto:peter@9thbit.net) _and_ messaging the `#org-appraisal-rb` channel on the Official Discord 👉️ [![Live Chat on Discord][✉️discord-invite-img]][✉️discord-invite]. If both of your contact attempts fail to elicit a response within the time period allotted in [Big Business][big-business] the licensor will consider that equivalent to a fair commercial license under [Big Business][big-business].

# 🤑 A request for help

Maintainers have teeth and need to pay their dentists.
After getting laid off in an RIF in March, and encountering difficulty finding a new one,
I began spending most of my time building open source tools.
I'm hoping to be able to pay for my kids' health insurance this month,
so if you value the work I am doing, I need your support.
Please consider sponsoring me or the project.

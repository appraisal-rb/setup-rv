# Building rv, ore, and gemfile-go from Source - Feature Documentation

## Overview

setup-ruby-flash now supports building `rv`, `ore`, and `gemfile-go` from git branches, tags, or commits instead of using released binaries. This enables testing unreleased versions without creating formal releases.

## New Inputs

### `rv-git-ref`

**Description**: Git branch, tag, or commit SHA to build rv from source.

**When set**: rv will be built from the specified git ref instead of using a release binary.

**Toolchain**: Rust toolchain is automatically installed if needed (via `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable`)

**Fork Support**: Use `owner:ref` syntax to build from a fork (e.g., `pboling:feat/my-fix`)

**Examples**:

- `'main'` - Build from main branch
- `'feat/new-feature'` - Build from feature branch
- `'v0.5.0-beta'` - Build from pre-release tag
- `'abc123'` - Build from specific commit
- `'pboling:feat/github-token-authenticated-requests'` - Build from fork

**Default**: `''` (empty - uses release binary)

**Overrides**: When set, `rv-version` input is ignored

### `ore-git-ref`

**Description**: Git branch, tag, or commit SHA to build ore from source.

**When set**: ore will be built from the specified git ref instead of using a release binary.

**Toolchain**: Go toolchain is automatically installed if needed (via `actions/setup-go@v5` with `stable`)

**Fork Support**: Use `owner:ref` syntax to build from a fork (e.g., `yourname:feat/my-fix`)

**Examples**:

- `'main'` - Build from main branch
- `'feat/bundle-gemfile-support'` - Build from feature branch
- `'v0.19.0-alpha'` - Build from pre-release tag
- `'def456'` - Build from specific commit
- `'contriboss:feat/my-enhancement'` - Build from fork

**Default**: `''` (empty - uses release binary)

**Overrides**: When set, `ore-version` input is ignored

### `gfgo-git-ref`

**Description**: Git branch, tag, or commit SHA to build gemfile-go from source when building ore from source.

**When set**: gemfile-go will be checked out and used via a Go workspace (`go.work`) when building ore. Only takes effect when `ore-git-ref` is also set.

**Toolchain**: Uses the same Go toolchain as ore (no additional setup needed)

**Fork Support**: Use `owner:ref` syntax to build from a fork (e.g., `yourname:feat/my-fix`)

**Examples**:

- `'main'` - Build from main branch
- `'feat/new-parser'` - Build from feature branch
- `'v1.2.3'` - Build from pre-release tag
- `'xyz789'` - Build from specific commit
- `'contriboss:feat/performance'` - Build from fork

**Default**: `''` (empty - uses gemfile-go version specified in ore's go.mod)

**Requirements**: Must be used with `ore-git-ref` (ignored if `ore-git-ref` is not set)

**How it works**: Creates a `go.work` file in the ore build directory that references the local gemfile-go checkout, allowing ore to use the specified gemfile-go version without modifying go.mod or go.sum

**Implementation Approach**: Following the recommended Go workspace approach:

1. **Uses `go.work` workspace** - Clean, standard Go approach for multi-repo development
2. **No go.mod modifications** - Avoids accidental commits of replace directives
3. **Automatic in CI** - Checkouts and workspace setup handled by the action
4. **Optional for local dev** - Developers can create go.work manually if needed

**Benefits**:

- **For CI/CD**: Test unreleased features before formal releases, validate compatibility between ore and gemfile-go changes, reproducible builds with commit SHAs, fast cached builds on subsequent runs
- **For Development**: No go.mod pollution, standard Go workspace approach, easy to enable/disable (just add/remove go.work), works same way in CI and locally
- **For Security**: Fork syntax allows testing security patches before merge, commit SHA pinning ensures reproducibility, separate cache keys prevent cross-contamination


## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Test BUNDLE_GEMFILE Fix in ore-light

```yaml
name: Test ore BUNDLE_GEMFILE fix

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test-ore-fix:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6

      - name: Setup Ruby with ore from feature branch
        uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: "3.4"
          ore-install: true
          ore-git-ref: "feat/bundle-gemfile-support" # Build from feature branch

      - name: Verify ore respects BUNDLE_GEMFILE
        env:
          BUNDLE_GEMFILE: Appraisal.root.gemfile
        run: |
          ore install
          # Should use Appraisal.root.gemfile instead of Gemfile
```

### Example 2: Test rv Pre-release

```yaml
name: Test rv beta

on: [push]

jobs:
  test-rv-beta:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6

      - name: Setup Ruby with rv beta
        uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: "3.4"
          rv-git-ref: "v0.5.0-beta1" # Build from beta tag

      - name: Test with beta rv
        run: |
          rv --version
          ruby --version
```

### Example 3: Test Both from Source

        uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: "3.4"
          rv-git-ref: "main" # Latest rv from main
          ore-install: true
          ore-git-ref: "main" # Latest ore from main

      - name: Verify installations
        run: |

          ore-install: true
          ore-git-ref: "feat/new-feature" # Test feature branch of ore
          gfgo-git-ref: "feat/parser-update" # Test feature branch of gemfile-go

      - name: Verify installations
        run: |
          ore --version
          ruby --version
          
      - name: Test gem installation
        run: |
          ore install
          ore list
```

### Example 4: Test Specific Commit

```yaml
name: Test specific commit

on: [push]

jobs:
  test-commit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6

      - name: Setup with specific ore commit
        uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: "3.4"
          ore-install: true
          ore-git-ref: "a1b2c3d4e5f6" # Specific commit SHA
```

### Example 5: Test from Your Fork

```yaml
name: Test rv fork with auth fix

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test-fork:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6

      - name: Setup with rv from fork
        uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: "3.4"
          rv-git-ref: "pboling:feat/github-token-authenticated-requests" # Build from fork

      - name: Test with forked rv
        env:
          RUST_LOG: debug
        run: |
          rv --version
          # Should show authentication being used
          rv ruby install 3.4
```

## How It Works

### Build Process Flow

#### For rv (Rust)

1. **Cache Check**: Checks if binary for this git ref is cached
2. **Rust Setup**: If not cached and `rv-git-ref` is set, installs Rust toolchain
3. **Parse Fork Syntax**: Checks if ref contains `:` to determine fork vs upstream
4. **Clone & Build**:

   ```bash
   # If fork syntax (owner:ref)
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/owner/rv.git
   git checkout ref  # fetches ref if needed
   
   # Otherwise (upstream)
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/spinel-coop/rv.git
   git checkout ref  # fetches ref if needed
   
   # Build
   cargo build --release
   cp target/release/rv ~/.local/bin/rv
   rm -rf /tmp/rv-build  # cleanup
   ```

5. **Cache Store**: Binary is cached for subsequent runs

#### For ore (Go)

1. **Cache Check**: Checks if binary for this git ref and gfgo-git-ref is cached
2. **Go Setup**: If not cached and `ore-git-ref` is set, installs Go (stable)
3. **Parse Fork Syntax**: Checks if ref contains `:` to determine fork vs upstream
4. **Clone & Build ore**:

   ```bash
   # If fork syntax (owner:ref)
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/owner/ore-light.git
   git checkout ref  # fetches ref if needed
   
   # Otherwise (upstream)
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/contriboss/ore-light.git
   git checkout ref  # fetches ref if needed
   ```

5. **Optional: Clone & Setup gemfile-go** (if `gfgo-git-ref` is set):

   ```bash
   # Clone gemfile-go with fork syntax support
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/owner/gemfile-go.git
   git checkout ref  # fetches ref if needed
   
   # Create go.work in ore build directory
   cd /tmp/ore-build
   go work init .
   go work use /tmp/gemfile-go-build
   ```

6. **Build ore**:

   ```bash
   # Build (automatically uses go.work if present)
   go build -o ore ./cmd/ore
   cp ore ~/.local/bin/ore
   rm -rf /tmp/ore-build /tmp/gemfile-go-build  # cleanup
   ```

7. **Cache Store**: Binary is cached for subsequent runs

#### Why go.work for gemfile-go?

The `go.work` approach is cleaner than using `replace` directives in `go.mod`:

- **No modification of go.mod/go.sum**: Avoids risk of accidentally committing development changes
- **Automatic detection**: Go commands automatically use `go.work` if present
- **Multi-repo development**: Industry standard for working with local checkouts
- **Clean separation**: Development setup doesn't interfere with production builds

### Caching Strategy

**Cache Key Format**:

- rv: `setup-ruby-flash-rv-<platform>-<git-ref>-true`
- ore: `setup-ruby-flash-ore-<platform>-<git-ref>-true-gfgo-<gfgo-git-ref>`

**Benefits**:

- Git refs are cached separately from release versions
- Same git ref on same platform reuses cached binary
- `build-from-source=true` flag prevents collision with release binaries

**Example Cache Keys**:

- `setup-ruby-flash-rv-linux-amd64-main-true`
- `setup-ruby-flash-ore-darwin-arm64-feat/bundle-gemfile-support-true-gfgo-`
- `setup-ruby-flash-ore-linux-amd64-main-true-gfgo-feat/parser-update`
- `setup-ruby-flash-rv-linux-arm64-v0.5.0-beta-true`

## Local Development with gemfile-go

If you're developing on ore-light locally and want to test with a local gemfile-go checkout, you can create a `go.work` file in your ore-light directory:

### Setup (One-time)

```bash
# Assuming ore-light and gemfile-go are sibling directories
cd /path/to/ore-light

# Create go.work workspace
go work init .
go work use ../gemfile-go

# Add to .gitignore (if not already there)
echo "go.work" >> .gitignore
echo "go.work.sum" >> .gitignore
```

### Benefits

- **No go.mod changes**: Your go.mod and go.sum stay clean
- **Easy switching**: Delete go.work to go back to released version
- **Team friendly**: Can commit a minimal go.work if team uses standard layout
- **CI compatible**: Same approach works in GitHub Actions

### In CI (Automated)

The action handles this automatically when you set both `ore-git-ref` and `gfgo-git-ref`:

```yaml
- uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
  with:
    ore-git-ref: "main"
    gfgo-git-ref: "main"  # Creates go.work automatically
```

## Performance Considerations

### First Run (No Cache)

**With git ref** (builds from source):

- rv: ~3-5 minutes (Rust compilation)
- ore: ~1-2 minutes (Go compilation)
- ore + gemfile-go: ~2-3 minutes (additional checkout and workspace setup)

**With release** (downloads binary):

- rv: ~5-10 seconds
- ore: ~5-10 seconds

### Subsequent Runs (Cached)

**Same for both**:

- rv: ~1-2 seconds (cache restore)
- ore: ~1-2 seconds (cache restore)

### Recommendations

1. **Use git refs for testing only** - Not recommended for production CI
2. **Prefer release versions for speed** - When possible
3. **Cache hits are fast** - Once built, git refs are as fast as releases
4. **Pin commits for stability** - Use commit SHAs instead of branch names if consistency matters

## Build Requirements

### Automatically Installed When Needed

#### For rv

- ✅ Rust toolchain (via `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable`)
- ✅ Cargo (comes with Rust)
- ✅ git (pre-installed on GitHub runners)

#### For ore

- ✅ Go toolchain (via `actions/setup-go@v5` with `stable`)
- ✅ git (pre-installed on GitHub runners)

### Pre-installed on Runners

- ✅ git
- ✅ Standard build tools (make, gcc, etc.)

## Testing

The CI workflow includes dedicated jobs to test building from source:

### test-rv-git-ref
- Tests building rv from main branch
- Verifies rv installation and Ruby version management

### test-ore-git-ref
- Tests building ore from master branch
- Verifies ore installation and gem management

### test-gfgo-git-ref
- Tests building ore from master with gemfile-go from main
- Runs on both ubuntu-latest and macos-latest
- Verifies ore installation works correctly
- Tests gem installation and management with custom gemfile-go

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails - Invalid Git Ref

**Error**:

```text
fatal: couldn't find remote ref feat/typo-branch
```

**Solution**: Verify the branch/tag exists in the repository

### Build Fails - Compilation Error

**Error**:

```text
error: could not compile `rv` (bin "rv")
```

**Solution**:

- The git ref may be broken or incompatible
- Try a different ref (e.g., latest release tag)
- Check the rv/ore repository for known issues

### Cache Not Working

**Symptom**: Builds from source every time

**Solution**:

- Verify cache key is stable (don't use dynamic values in git-ref)
- Check GitHub Actions cache limits (10GB per repo)
- Consider using commit SHA instead of branch name for stability

## Comparison: Git Ref vs Release

| Aspect                | Git Ref                     | Release Binary     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Speed (first run)** | ❌ Slow (3-5 min)           | ✅ Fast (5-10 sec) |
| **Speed (cached)**    | ✅ Fast (1-2 sec)           | ✅ Fast (1-2 sec)  |
| **Use Case**          | Testing unreleased features | Production CI      |
| **Stability**         | ⚠️ May be unstable          | ✅ Stable releases |
| **Flexibility**       | ✅ Any commit/branch        | ❌ Only releases   |
| **Setup Complexity**  | ⚠️ Requires toolchain       | ✅ Simple download |

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO

- Use git refs for testing PRs and feature branches
- Use commit SHAs for reproducible builds
- Cache aggressively (same git ref = same binary)
- Document which git ref you're testing in workflow names

### ❌ DON'T

- Use git refs in production CI (slow first build)
- Use dynamic branch names that change frequently
- Forget to test with actual releases before merging
- Mix git refs and release versions without clear reason

## Migration Guide

### From Release to Git Ref

**Before**:

```yaml
- uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
  with:
    ore-version: "0.18.0"
    ore-install: true
```

**After**:

```yaml
- uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
  with:
    ore-git-ref: "feat/bundle-gemfile-support" # ore-version ignored when ore-git-ref set
    ore-install: true
```

### From Git Ref Back to Release

**Before**:

```yaml
- uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
  with:
    ore-git-ref: "feat/bundle-gemfile-support"
    ore-install: true
```

**After**:

```yaml
- uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
  with:
    ore-git-ref: "" # Clear git ref
    ore-version: "latest" # Use latest release
    ore-install: true
```

Or simply remove the `ore-git-ref` line:

```yaml
- uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@v1
  with:
    ore-version: "latest"
    ore-install: true
```

## Real-World Use Case: Testing new ore feature branch

**Workflow**:

```yaml
name: Test new ore feature

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test-with-fix:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      BUNDLE_GEMFILE: ${{ github.workspace }}/Appraisal.root.gemfile

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6

      - name: Setup Ruby with ore fix
        uses: appraisal-rb/setup-ruby-flash@main
        with:
          ruby-version: "3.4"
          ore-install: true
          # Use ore with a feature before it's released
          ore-git-ref: "feat/a-good-feature"

      - name: Verify fix works
        run: |
          ore install
          test -f Appraisal.root.gemfile.lock
```

## Summary

The `rv-git-ref` and `ore-git-ref` inputs provide a powerful way to test unreleased versions of rv and ore directly in CI without creating formal releases. This is especially useful for:

- ✅ Testing PR changes before merge
- ✅ Validating bug fixes in feature branches
- ✅ Testing pre-release versions (alpha/beta tags)
- ✅ Reproducing issues with specific commits
- ✅ Developing setup-ruby-flash itself

While slower on first run, caching makes subsequent runs fast, making this a practical option for testing workflows.
